        <h2 style="color: #0B4F6C !important;">SLASummit 2017</h2>
        <p style="color: #0B4F6C !important;">Dear Participants, 

<strong>How can you change the lives of more than 30 people with less than $5,000?</strong>

<p>This is the question we ask every SLASummit, and it’s not an arbitrary one. It is grounded in a personal experience that has become the foundation of our mission and vision. From that experience, we know that you can effect tangible change with limited funds. Your efforts can multiply when you know where to direct your resources. You can enable a community to empower itself rather than relying on traditional development structures.</p>

<p>Thus, it is with great pride that we welcome you to the third edition of SLASummit, in the cosmopolitan city of Montreal, a hub for innovation and social entrepreneurship. You come from different places and diverse fields of study, united by an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to learn and do good. We at SLASummit firmly believe that students like you are the future.</p>

<p>Yet you – or, more accurately, we – should also be the present. We should be able to make a change and have a positive voice in the world. That is exactly what we are trying to foster: young leaders who have the tools and the passion to work with the world’s poor, and who see them as worthy of dignity and cooperation rather than just aid money. Our area of focus is Latin America. Thus, as we introduce to you El Alto, see it as a microcosm for some of the some of the region’s most pressing issues. Consider how people in this community, and throughout Latin America, can use small-scale interventions to create large-scale change.</p>

<p>We trust that bringing together young leaders from different socio-cultural backgrounds can only spark change – not only in a target community but in the larger fields of social enterprise and sustainable development. We hope you are as committed to this endeavour as we are, and know that we are honoured to have you here with us.
</p>

With a BA in Political Science from UQAM, and starting her Master’s in the same subject, she became Youth Leadership Advisor for Cuso International.

Yet she sought more practical experience with community-based approaches. This led her to work in a Cameroonian high school, where she strengthened the staff’s capabilities, assisted the bilingual program, started a student-run organic garden, and supported social inclusion in general.</p>
